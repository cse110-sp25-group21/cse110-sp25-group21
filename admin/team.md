## 🧑‍🚀 Who is Seekdeep?

We are a team of **11 developers** with roots across the world — from the United States 🇺🇸, China 🇨🇳, to Germany 🇩🇪. Our diversity drives creativity and brings unique perspectives to everything we build. Our super creative name got inspiration from our group number 21, and is in no way affiliated with anything else. We love national security! 

Our mission is to build a card-based website, and make sure to take showers along the way. As we seek deeper into our codebase in search of bugs, we hope to gain newfound skills and appreciation for software engineering, improving ourselves as both developers and teammates. Armed with GitHub, dreams, and way too many tabs open, Seekdeep is diving headfirst into the world of web development. Pray for our sleep schedules.

## Inspiration


In the wild world of code, every unexpected bug and caffeine-fueled all-nighter is a badge of honor. Embrace the chaos—each glitch is a stepping stone toward innovative breakthroughs. Remember, your unique quirks fuel creativity: what seems like spaghetti code today is the blueprint of tomorrow's solutions. So, when the code gets messy and the timelines feel stretched, let the humor in our late-night fixes and insane commit messages remind you that greatness is born out of persistence, passion, and a relentless drive to break the mold. Keep pushing, keep coding, and never forget—every line is a legacy in the making.
