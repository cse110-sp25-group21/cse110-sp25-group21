### What Was Discussed
- What was good in our organization, what is helding us back and how to improve
- Doing good: in - team communications, consistency, having issues assigned ahead, and overall vibe
- Not so good: lack of communication between teams, unstable attendance, individuals behind progress, vague issue instructions, lack of updates
- how to improve: being more communicative (potentially daily checkin), have slack channels for every team, better issue description
