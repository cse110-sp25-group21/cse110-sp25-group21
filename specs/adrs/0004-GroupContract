# Make Group Contract, set rules and punishments and clear definitions of roles

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team needs a set of well defined rules, values, objectives, protocols, and how to deal with conflict in order to create a good working environment.

## Decision Drivers

* Course Assignment
* Need rules and objectives
* Need consequences for bad behavior to incentivise work


## Considered Options

* Follow the guideline that the assignment gave
* Deviate a bit

## Decision Outcome
* We made the contract put in admin/misc/rules.md
* We deviated from following the guideline exactly

### Consequences

* **Positive**:
  - Everyone knows the rules and the consequences of not following them
  - Values are set so people feel safe to speak up if they don't know anything

* **Negative**:
  - None
