# Use Miro for remote brainstorming sessions

## Context and Problem Statement

Our CSE110 team needs a collaborative, persistent whiteboarding tool for remote brainstorming. We evaluated several lightweight drawing/wireframe apps but sought a platform that supported live collaboration, had flexible drawing and diagramming primitives, and would retain our work over the entire project.

## Decision Drivers

* Live, multi-user collaboration  
* Persistence of boards over time  
* Rich drawing/diagramming capabilities (stickies, shapes, connectors)  
* Ease of sharing/embed (link-based)  
* Instructor recommendation  

## Considered Options

* Miro  
* Google Jamboard  
* FigJam  
* Google Slides (annotating slides by hand)  

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Miro**, because it satisfies all our drivers—real-time multi-user editing, durable boards, and a full palette of whiteboard tools—and was recommended by the professor.

### Consequences

* **Positive**:  
  - Seamless collaboration without version drift  
  - Ability to export boards as images/PDF for specs  
* **Negative**:  
  - Slight learning curve for some members  
  - Free plan limits number of editable boards (we’ll need to manage or archive old boards)  

### Confirmation

We will confirm adoption by holding our first full-team brainstorming on Miro, exporting the board to `/specs/brainstorm/` as PDF, and ensuring everyone can revisit and edit it.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Miro

* Good, because it offers persistent, link-shareable boards  
* Good, because of extensive shape libraries and templates  
* Bad, because the free tier caps board count  

### Google Jamboard

* Good, because it’s part of Google Workspace  
* Neutral, because it has fewer shapes and connectors  
* Bad, because it doesn’t persist unlimited boards without manual download  

## More Information

Professor’s course materials recommended Miro. We’ll archive each meeting’s board export in `/specs/brainstorm/`.
