# Create Contract and Decide Rules/Positions

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team needs rules as well as roles for the group project and so we need to assign them as well as see how comfortable people are with coding

## Decision Drivers

* Course Assignment
* Need clear structure


## Considered Options

* Everyone works at one time
* Assigned pairs/small groups
* Each given a role and work on it individually

## Decision Outcome
* We will use teams for backend, frontend, documentation and design
* To get exposure for the roles we will switch the teams around midway through

| Teams | Week 6,7, 8| Week 9, 10|
| ------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Documentation | Sophie | Mohan |
| Designer | Charlotte, Darian, Vijay | Edison, Chester, Tommy |
| Frontend | Lisa, Ryan, Tommy | Akhil, Charlotte, Vijay |
| Backend | Akhil, Mohan, Edison, Chester | Lisa, Ryan, Sophie, Darian |



### Consequences

* **Positive**:
  - Quicker work
  - People get exposure to different roles

* **Negative**:
  - People might struggle to understand the code or need time after switcing teams

### Confirmation
We will confirm this by maintaining these teams throughout the quarter
