## Jim (Broke College Student)
As a busy and broke college student, I just want to find affordable and tasty food quickly without having to overthink it. I’m on a tight budget, so I need fast recommendations that won’t break the bank. It’s also important to me that I can trust reviews from other students—because they get where I’m coming from.

## Tim (Tourist)
As a tourist, I want to experience real local food, not just the usual tourist traps. I don’t want to waste time scrolling through endless options, so I’m looking for quick, to-the-point recommendations that come with great photos. That way, I can get a good idea of what the place is really like without having to dig deep into long reviews.

## Kim (Content Creator)
As a content creator, I’m always on the lookout for trendy food spots before they get mainstream. I need recommendations for places that look amazing on camera and will pop in my photos. It would also be super helpful if saving and planning my visits was as easy as possible—so I can keep track of all these great spots without losing track.
