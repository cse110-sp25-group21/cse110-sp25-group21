# Use Cases

## Use Case 1: Swiping Through Food Recommendations
The goal is to quickly find a restaurant. It starts when you open the app. Right when you open it, you're presented with a customized deck of food places. You swipe right to save a restaurant or swipe left to dismiss it. If you like a place, you can tap the star icon to "favorite" it. But if you strongly dislike a restaurant, you can tap the cross (X) to block it from showing up in future decks.

## Use Case 2: Filtering by Dietary Needs and etc.
If you have dietary restrictions, the goal is to only see restaurants that match them. First, you open the app settings and pick out your filters (like "Vegetarian" or "Gluten-free"). Then you go back to the deck, and now only the restaurants that meet the filters will show up. Makes it easier to find places that actually work for your diet.

## Use Case 3: Creating a Custom Food Deck
Sometimes, you want to organize your favorite spots into themed libraries, like "Brunch" or "Date Night." You open your saved favorites, then tap "Create New Library." You give the library a name, like "Late Night Eats." After that, you pick out restaurants you want to add to the library. Once itâ€™s set up, you can go back and manage your libraries anytime to keep track of your favorite spots.
