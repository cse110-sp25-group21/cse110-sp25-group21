1. **User Research**  
- Purpose and target users (personas, user stories)  
1. \[x\] Purpose: Serve food loving individuals in UCSD (and potentially around the UTC area) a way to choose their next dining option  
2. \[x\] Targeted users: college students, touristsâ€¦  
- User expected functionality  
1. \[x\] Ability to choose an nearby dining place for user  
2. **Designs and webpage specifications**  
- Expected minimum (core) functionality  
1. Capability for users to build custom decks with restaurant cards  
2. Capability for users to rate each restaurant cards  
3. Capability for users to comment each restaurant cards  
4. Capability for users to switch between different decks through swiping  
- Target platform  
1. Potentially PC browser at start  
2. Maybe tryout phone browser after week 8  
- General UI & UX design and graphic styles  
1. Decide color scheme  
2. Decide animation style for button  
3. Decide animation style for Page Flipping  
4. Decide animation for User inputs  
- Wireframes  
1. Design wireframe template for Blank page template  
2. Design wireframe template for Standard Buttons  
3. Design wireframes for Standard Restaurant Card  
4. Design wireframes for Start page (also menu page)  
5. Design wireframes for Deck page  
- graphic asset requirement lists  
1. A design for menu background  
2. A design for Buttons  
3. Graphical Design for Standard Restaurant Card  
4. Graphical Design for Start page (also menu page)  
5. Graphical Design for Deck page  
3. **Preparation for development**  
- File organization  
1. Decide where to put graphical assets, html, css, and js files and how to navigate them  
- Code convention  
1. Decide the standard for documentation  
2. My advice: at lease a summary for all js functions, a brief summary for every html element or css block  
- PR rules and testings (CI & CD)  
1. Which feature require a separate branch and PR  
2. How PRs are verified, and who is in charge

4. **Front End prototyping**  
- Website architecture (webpage topology)  
1. Decode how each page is connected, and what will user experience during the navigation  
- UI element prototypes (html)  
1. Start with blank wireframes / simple shapes for prototyping  
2. Replace the wireframes with actual graphical assets  
- UI style prototypes (CSS)  
1. Find appropriate font for UI elements  
2. Apply custom fonts and sizes to elements  
3. Apply animations to button elements  
4. Apply animations to pageflip  
5. Apply animations to desk swipe  
6. Implement feedback animations for user inputs  
5. **Back End prototyping**  
- General organization (js file organization)  
- Tech prototypes for api test  
1. A small prototype for yelp api  
2. A small prototype for deck editing and storage  
- Function templates tied to html elements  
- Function prototypes  
6. **Testing & iterative refinement**  
- Alpha (internal) test for the completed prototype, focus on tech issues and debugging; submit issues for both bugs and user experience enhancements, but with different tags; should resolve technical bugs first.  
- Beta test (still mostly internal, maybe invite someone outside team for testing) for the technically functional prototype, focuses on refining user experience.  
7. **Delivery & Presentation**
