# Introduction
Our project, "Powell's Bowells" is a website where people can input the restaurants they want to save into decks and when they select each deck, it'll show one restaurant to reccommend, which makes deciding what restaurant to go to a lot easier!

# What it does
It allows users to create their own card decks with restaurants as cards. Once a user inputs their restaurant's information (name, address, menu, etc.) it will save that restaurant in that deck and the next time the user selects that deck, it'll show one of the user's restaurants. This makes it easy for the user to pick a restaurant they want to go to.
